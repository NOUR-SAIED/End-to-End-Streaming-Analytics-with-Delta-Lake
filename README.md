# End-to-End-Streaming-Analytics-with-Delta-Lake
This project implements an end to end real time data analytics platform for sales events. It ingests transactional data as a continuous stream, stores it reliably using a Delta Lake lakehouse architecture, and exposes business ready analytics through structured queries and dashboards.
